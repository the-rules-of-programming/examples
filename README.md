This repo contains all the source examples from the book The Rules of Programming.

All of the examples will build and run, but they've received only cursory testing.
I've left the testing code in place, if you're curious to see what actually was tested.
I am entirely certain that there are still bugs in the code.
If you bump into one and want to see it fixed, just send me a note.

The examples were built and tested with Visual Studio
I've included the project files for VS; it should be trivial to incorporate them into some other build system.

Many of the examples are Potemkin code, so don't be surprised to find empty implementations of tantalizingly-named functions.
A few of the examples might actually be useful, like the JSON struct unpacker in Chapter 16.
My advice would be to not trust the code too much.
Sure, it's had some light testing, but it hasn't been used in production.
If you've read the book, you know what that means--it doesn't work, at least not perfectly.
